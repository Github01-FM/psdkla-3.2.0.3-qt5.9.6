DESCRIPTION: WebP is a method of lossy and lossless compression that can be                used on a large variety of photographic, translucent and                graphical images found on the web. The degree of lossy                compression is adjustable so a user can choose the trade-off                between file size and image quality. WebP typically achieves                an average of 30% more compression than JPEG and JPEG 2000,                without loss of image quality.
SUMMARY: WebP is an image format designed for the Web
