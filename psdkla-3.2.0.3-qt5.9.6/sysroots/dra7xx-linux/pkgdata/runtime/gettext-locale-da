DESCRIPTION_gettext-locale-da: GNU gettext is a set of tools that provides a framework to help other programs produce multi-lingual messages. These tools include a set of conventions about how programs should be written to support message catalogs, a directory and file naming organization for the message catalogs themselves, a runtime library supporting the retrieval of translated messages, and a few stand-alone programs to massage in various ways the sets of translatable and already translated strings.  This package contains language translation files for the da locale.
